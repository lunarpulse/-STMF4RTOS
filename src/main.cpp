// Standalone STM32F4 led blink sample (trace via DEBUG).
//
// In debug configurations, demonstrate how to print a greeting message
// on the trace device. In release configurations the message is
// simply discarded.
//
// Then demonstrates how to blink a led with 1 Hz, using a
// continuous loop and SysTick delays.
//
// Trace support is enabled by adding the TRACE macro definition.
// By default the trace messages are forwarded to the DEBUG output,
// but can be rerouted to any device or completely suppressed, by
// changing the definitions required in system/src/diag/trace_impl.c
// (currently OS_USE_TRACE_ITM, OS_USE_TRACE_SEMIHOSTING_DEBUG/_STDOUT).
